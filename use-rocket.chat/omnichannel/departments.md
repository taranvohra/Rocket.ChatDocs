# Departments

An Omnichannel Department is a collection of rooms that can be configured based on a category as needed. These departments can be related directly to the various departments in your company. [Live Chat](livechat-widget-installation.md) conversations can be directed to a specific department.

{% hint style="info" %}
A typical use case is when you have Live Chat conversations initiated from different places or pages of your website and need them handled by various departments or groups of knowledge experts. You can [assign an agent to a department](agents.md#assign-omnichannel-agent-to-a-department).
{% endhint %}

To access this menu,

* Go to **Administration > Omnichannel > Departments**. Here, you can **View**, **Create New**, **Edit,** or **Delete** a department.

## **Create Omnichannel Department**

To create a new Omnichannel department:

* Click +**New** on the top right of the screen
* Fill in the required [information](departments.md#omnichannel-department-information) and click **Save.**

{% hint style="info" %}
From community edition workspaces on version `6.0` and above, you can only create one department. To create multiple departments, you are required to upgrade to the [enterprise edition ](../../setup-and-configure/enterprise-edition-trial.md)of Rocket.Chat. For workspaces with multiple departments on previous versions of Rocket.Chat, you can continue with those departments but can't create a new one until you upgrade to Enterprise.

## Archive Omnichannel Department

When an Omnichannel department is no longer needed, but you don't want to delete it just yet, you can archive it. You can also unarchive it later if you discover a need for it.

{% hint style="info" %}
For community edition workspaces below version `6.0` with multiple departments, archiving departments can be instrumental if you want to avoid getting an enterprise license. Instead of deleting a department when you no longer need it, you can archive it. When you need that department later, you can unarchive it. This gives community edition workspaces below version `6.0` the ability to retain the same number of departments they had before the upgrade.
